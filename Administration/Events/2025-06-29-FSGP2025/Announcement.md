Hello @everyone, we were invited to this year's Formula Sun Grand Prix in Kentucky, and I need to know who is going so that the coordinators can make us entry badges. I also need to know what dates we plan to be there for.

I think that we should be there for at least one of the "scrutineering" days as they will be the most beneficial to us. So maybe we get there Tue July 1st and leave Thu July 3rd.

Here is the event schedule

If you are available for this opportunity, react to this message with days you could go and I will add you to a group chat so we can discuss further plans about transportation, food, and accommodation. The tentative plan is to drive there and camp on the track.

**I need confirmation by tomorrow night at the latest.**
