- Design
	- Aero discussion
		- Flat top minimal aerodynamic consideration
	- Vehicle body
		- Solar canopy discussion
			- Metal extrusion
				- Strong
				- weldable
			- vs Composite
				- Light
				- Flat shape means it won't be too difficult to manufacture
		- Cockpit discussion
			- Triangulated tube roll cage and lower occupant cell
			- Composite shell for aerodynamics, safety and rules compliance
		- Chassis construction
			- Tube chassis
	- Solar cells
		- Laminated
			- Price?
			- durability?
		- Non-Laminated
			- Must laminate -> $
			- Price?
			- durability?
	- Wheels
		- Build
			- Most teams use cnc milling process on aluminum
			  aka expensive
			- better suited for hub motors
			- what other possible manufacturing methods are there?
			- Lightweight
		- Vs buy
			- saves a lot of time
			- might not find the right wheels
	- Motors
		- Hub
			- 1 count
				- Solar Gators uses
				- Seems Unbalanced
				- Light
			- 2 count
				- expensive
				- mechanically redundant
				- Heavy
				- Two Inverter circuits
				- Presumably less efficient
			- Unsprung weight
		- Inboard
			- Complex
			- Drivetrain loses
			- Heavy
			- Sprung weight
	- Suspension
		- Rear trailing arm
- Vehicle naming brainstorm
