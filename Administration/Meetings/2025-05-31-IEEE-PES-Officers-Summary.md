# IEEE PES Officer Meeting Summary

IEEE PES (Power & Energy Society) officers met with us to discuss a potential partnership. We spent most of the meeting explaining the details of the club and where we are currently at in the design phase.
They said they would come to our next meeting (June 4th). 
They were enthusiastic about doing a joint social event like bowling or a partial proceeds event like blaze pizza, and chipotle.
