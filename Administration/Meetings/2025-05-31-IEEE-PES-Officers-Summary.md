# IEEE PES Officer Meeting Summary

IEEE PES (Power & Energy Society) officers met this weekend to discuss a potential partnership. In attendance was Me, Walker, Alex (PES President), Grace, Adrian, and two other officers were on the phone but I didn't get their names. We spent most of the meeting explaining the details of our club and what stage we are currently at in the design process.
They suggested that we speak at one of their GBMs but they do not have one until fall. So we asked if they would come to our next meeting (June 4th). I will follow up with them now to check if they will show up. If they do, we should be prepared to answer any questions they have and generally just make connections.
They were enthusiastic about doing a joint social event like bowling or a partial proceeds event like blaze pizza, and chipotle.
