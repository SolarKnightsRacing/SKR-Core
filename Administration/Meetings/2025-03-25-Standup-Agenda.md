# Agenda
## 501c3 and Nonprofit notes: 
- Will talk to accountant to check (Connor knows a guy)
- Whole point of registering as FL entity is to not have liability for any members
- Bank guy (not too reliable) said that we did it correctly for the club: Setting up the EIN using Connors social and the name of the club - but I dont think this is a real entity?
 	- UCF says RSO's are not an entity of the University
- BUT.. We need a Registered Florida nonprofit entity to get the 501c3
 	- https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/before-applying-for-tax-exempt-status
- If we register as a Florida entity, would need to set up a new bank account in the nonprofit entity's EIN, Connor would be the Registered Agent
 	- Then we use the EIN from the nonprofit entity to get the 501c3
   	- Doing it this way should take liability away from Connor
- Check/ask about 	
 	- How UCF handles clubs that are registered as a nonprofit or are tax exempt
   	- If everything above looks correct and if we're doing this right
