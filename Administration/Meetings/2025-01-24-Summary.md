What are your goals for the club?
* A lot of people have been saying that they want to gain experience, learn, and a lot of freshmen are glad that they're going to have the ability to learn and get hands-on experience even though they might not have the credentials or experience.

Our mission/objective: Is to give everyone experience and to create interest in a club

Connor Hoffman will be organizing solid works workshop classes. And we teach you on how to design and be able to utilize SolidWorks.

Fundraising- We will try to get donations from Duke energy and other companies. Also, we are holding fundraising events throughout the year.

- SGA will pay for half, if we get people interested and committed to Solar Knights
- 50,000 to fundraise for the car plus event fees
- Trying to become a non-profit (to cut taxes and this will help get donations from other companies).
- Grants
- Getting people to go to the racetrack will help fundraise money if we volunteer (Eric). It's a one time volunteer opportunity and you’ll most likely be handing out food and stuff like that.

Workshop location: Baja & Formula location

Basic Time frame- Aaron
