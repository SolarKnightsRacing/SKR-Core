Introduction of all officers:

- Connor Hoffman (President)
- Aaron Riddle (Vice President)
- Malachy Crossan (Team Lead)
- Alex Disharoon (Treasurer)
- Matthew Reid (Secretary) 
- Erick Enriquez-Vega (Reporter)
- Ryan McConnaghy (Parliamentarian)

Introduction of faculty sponsor:

- Thanks to Dr. Shawn Putnam for sponsoring Solar Knights Racing (SKR). Without him, we would not have an experienced personnel to help guide our members to success.

Open Discussion:

- SKR Objectives: Attending members discussed what they expected to receive from the club, as well as ideas they had on how to run the club or things they would want to see the club achieve. 

- Members expect to gain experience from the club. This is expected of all members as members are expected to work on the car or help with fundraising.

- Members want to have fun in the club. This is the heart of what the officer team aims to accomplish with SKR. Yes it will be a lot of hard work, however we believe in having fun in any circumstance. 

- Funding: Much of the main concern for the club is funding. The first semester, as well as during the summer, is expected to be dedicated to fundraising and gaining sponsorships. 

- Shop Space: Another concern from attending members was shop space. Currently, we do not have a shop space as we are not an official RSO yet. However, that is at the top of the to-do list for us. That is something we will have to discuss with the SGA

- When will designing and construction begin? For the first semester or two, fundraising is the main goal. Spring 2025 and Summer 2025 are going to be largely fundraising so the club has enough money to design and build a competent race car. Summer 2025 will begin to see beginning phases of the design process, with Fall 2025 likely being the time for serious designing and construction. 

- Dues: Dues have been set in the constitution as of now at $25 for a semester or $40 for a year. If this is a concern for you, please contact one of the officer members in the discord. 


Things to note for the club and its future:


- We are expecting to gain many sponsorships to help in the development of the race car. Specifically in the compositing stage for the aero-shell. To help with this, the club is going to speak with the state government about becoming a 501C3 Non-Profit. Businesses are more likely to accept sponsorship deals with non-profits due to tax benefits

- Fundraising will likely be a slew of things. Restaurant fundraising is a big hit typically, and Erick has experience in this field. 

- The officer team aims to offer SolidWorks training for new members who have little to no CAD training. The team wants it to be as easy as possible for new members to join and get involved in a subsystem that interests them

- Guest speaker events are in the books for SKR. We have to research further into this. 


  

Closing Remarks:

Solar Knights Racing was created to help anyone and everyone interested to gain real world experience in alternative energy solutions and to be a part of a genuine and exciting new club. With the club being founded just this year, new members can contribute to a brand new solar race car, meaning machine shop experience and welding experience, among other exciting opportunities are available to everyone. SKR does not cater only to upper level engineering majors either - our Parliamentarian is a Health Science major and two members of our officer team are freshmen. We hope that you will all join us in this incredible journey. If you have any questions, please feel free to message any of the officers on the discord server.
