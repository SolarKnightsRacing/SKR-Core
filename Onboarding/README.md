## 1. About Solar Knights Racing

![FSGP Formula Sun picture from American Solar Challenge's website](https://www.americansolarchallenge.org/ASC/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/FSGP-elecrek-FI-02.webp)Our objective is to design and build solar-powered vehicles to compete in races across the nation, showcasing the potential of sustainable transportation. Through this club, we aim to inspire environmental responsibility while providing UCF students with hands-on experience in leadership, engineering, business, programming, and manufacturing. Additionally, we foster interdisciplinary collaboration by bringing together students with diverse skill sets and backgrounds to achieve a common goal.
### The American Solar Challenge (ASC)
From the American solar challenge website:
>"The American Solar Challenge (ASC) is a multi-day, 1,500-2,000 mile cross-country endurance rally across North America. The event is typically held every other year during the summer and is open to collegiate level solar car teams from countries all over the world. The routes have varied greatly over the course of the eventâ€™s rich [history](https://www.americansolarchallenge.org/the-competion/event-history/ "Event History"), but they are always designed to provide teams with a great opportunity to demonstrate their solar cars under real world driving conditions and thoroughly test the reliability of all onboard systems."

### The Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP)
From the American solar challenge website:
>"The Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) is an annual track competition that is held on grand prix or road style closed courses. This unique style of solar car racing is open to teams from around the world and truly tests the limits of the vehicles in handling curves, braking, and acceleration. On years when the American Solar Challenge (ASC) is held, FSGP serves as the qualifier event for this competition. Teams must successfully complete FSGP to prove their vehicles before they are allowed to start the cross-country ASC journey. The racing strategy applied during the three day FSGP track event is different than the cross-country ASC event. Driver training, passing strategy, and quick pit stops are crucial for teams racing in FSGP. Itâ€™s also essential to have a diligent team member in the timing booth and follow all of the rules of the track to ensure all laps get counted."
