## Outline:
1. Welcome! In this quick introduction to GitHub, I'll guide you through forking a repository, making a change, committing that change, and finally, creating a pull request to include your changes on the master branch.
2. You'll be adding your contact card so that you can be an official contributor on the GitHub. While not all fields are required, providing as much information as you're comfortable with will help streamline communication. (you will see on the template that required fields are marked with asterisks) Once submitted, a reviewer will approve your pull request. Club members will receive edit privileges, allowing future changes without forking.
3. Start by logging into your professional GitHub account or creating one.
4. Search for `SKR-Core` in the GitHub search bar.
5. Make sure to star this repository for later.
6. Without write permissions, you must create a fork in order to make changes.
7. Click the **Fork** button (top-right) and proceed with the default settings.
8. Once forked, navigate to: `Operations/Administration/Contacts`.
9. Check an existing contact card for reference.
10. Copy the template from `README.md` by clicking **Copy raw contents**.
11. Create a new file named **Lastname-Firstname.md** (e.g., `Smith-John.md`).
12. Fill in your details.
13. Click **Commit changes** (top-right) to save.
14. To merge your changes into the main repository, open a pull request:
    - Go to your forked repository’s home page.
    - Click **Contribute** → **Create Pull Request**.
    - Optionally, introduce yourself (major, interests, goals, etc.).
    - Click **Create Pull Request**.
15. The next step is for someone with administrator privileges to accept your changes and they will grant you write access.
16. Continue the onboarding process.
