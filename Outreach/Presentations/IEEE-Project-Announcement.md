title if you would like to include it: "# Summer Project Opportunities with Solar Knights Racing"

Solar Knights Racing is a new engineering club on campus dedicated to designing and building a solar-powered vehicle to compete in races across the nation, including the American Solar Challengeâ€”a 2500+ mile cross-country competition.

We're seeking motivated individuals to contribute to four exciting technical projects that will provide real-world engineering experience and would be great to put on a resume or refer to in an interview. Whether you choose to lead a project or simply help with troubleshooting, your contribution will be highly appreciated!

## Projects:

Note: The "Skills" sections below are not prerequisites but rather skills you'll develop through participation in these projects

### 1. Battery pack
We need to design and build an approximately 5kWh lithium-based energy storage system.
The design will include:  
  - Storage bank
  - Battery Management System (BMS) 
  - High Voltage fuses and contactors
  - Bus bars and HV wiring
  - a Ventilation system

Skills: Power electronics

### 2. Battery Protection System (BPS)
  The BPS, not to be confused with the Battery Management System (BMS), is a required safety component for vehicles that Race in the American Solar Challenge. The BPS is the primary system which applies "Active Protection" to the vehicle. Measurements are constantly monitored from sources like the CAN bus and actions are taken to automatically put the car in a safe state by opening the main power contactors. (ASC 2026 Regulation 8.3.A.5)

Skills: PCB design, CAN protocol

### 3. Power Control Modules
We plan to distribute our low-voltage power control to individual Power Control Modules throughout the vehicle. Functions that are usually handled by a singular Power Distribution Module like: power switching, over/under current protection, over/under voltage protection, and power tracking, will be delegated to a single board per switched item. i.e. One PCM for the left headlight and another for the right headlight. These modules will be connected to the main CAN bus as their primary form of control.

Skills: PCB Design, CAN protocol

### 4. Driver HMI Firmware
  Despite the apprehension that most of us share about touch-screen controls in cars, most of the non-critical driver controls will only be available through a Human Machine Interface. This HMI will be running a Real-Time Operating System like tock or OxidOS, in order to guarantee that driver inputs will be predictable and reliable.
 
Skills:  Embedded programming,  Rust,  RTOS, CAN protocol,  UI Design
