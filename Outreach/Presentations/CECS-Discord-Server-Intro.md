## Solar Knights Racing (SKR) at UCF
### Who We Are

Welcome to **Solar Knights Racing** at **UCF!** Here at SKR, we design, develop, test, and race a full scale solar-powered race car. We compete against other schools across the nation in two different competitions: the **FSGP** and the **ASC** (or the Formula Sun Grand Prix and the American Solar Challenge).
### FSGP

The FSGP is a Grand Prix style race on a closed circuit raceway where solar teams will test their cars to the limit. This includes scrutineering, or tech inspection, and the actual racing. Scrutineering is the full-point inspection of every component of the car to ensure it meets every requirement in the rule book. The actual racing is on an actual closed circuit track where teams will compete against each other to achieve the best time in time trials across the track. The FSGP also serves as a qualifier for the ASC.

### ASC
 
The ASC is a 1500 to 2000 mile race across the country. In this competition, it's less of a race against other teams but rather against yourself - the ASC measures the endurance of your engineering for the solar car. The ASC is the ultimate test of engineering principles used in the design, development, and testing phases.

### Subsystems

- **Chassis:** Chassis designs the space-frame chassis along with mounting points for suspension, ergonomics, and general safety features
- **Vehicle Dynamics:** VD handles suspension geometry, brakes, steering, and anything that affects how the car drives
 - **Ergonomics: ** Ergo supports the driver and safety requirements, including the seat, harness setup, steering wheel placement, and other driver-oriented components
- **Electrical:** Electrical has two sub-subsystems: Low Voltage and High Voltage. Low voltage handles small components such as lights, driver screen, gauges, etc. High voltage handles much bigger components such as the Battery, high-power fuses, the electric motor, etc.

### Who Should Join
Anyone and everyone with a passion for anything engineering! Mechanical, Aerospace, Electrical, Photonics, business, etc. are all welcome to join! Simply arrive with a want to be apart of the team!
