## Solar Knights Racing at UCF

### Who We Are
Welcome to **Solar Knights Racing** at **UCF!** Here at SKR, we design, develop, test, and race a full-scale solar-powered race car. We compete against other schools across the nation in two different competitions: the **FSGP** and the **ASC** (or the Formula Sun Grand Prix and the American Solar Challenge).

### The Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP)
The FSGP is a Grand Prix style race on a closed circuit raceway where solar teams test their cars to the limit. The competition is held every summer and is comprised of scrutineering (technical inspection) and the actual racing. Scrutineering is the full-point inspection of every component of the car to ensure it meets every requirement in the regulations. The race is held on a closed circuit track where teams compete against each other to complete as many laps as they can in a three day endurance event.

### The American Solar Challenge (ASC)
The ASC is a 1,500 to 2,000 mile race across the country. The ASC is the ultimate test of the reliability and efficiency of your solar vehicle. It showcases engineering principles used in the design, development, and testing phases.

### Subsystems
- **Chassis:** the Chassis is responsible for designing and building the space-frame chassis, the canopy/shell that encloses it, and any mounting points for other vehicle components
- **Vehicle Dynamics:** the VD team handles suspension geometry, brakes, steering, and anything that affects how the car drives
- **Ergonomics:** the Ergo team supports the driver and safety requirements, including the seat, harness setup, steering wheel placement, and other driver-oriented components
- **Electrical:** the Electrical team has two main responsibilities: Low Voltage and High Voltage. Low voltage consists of any electronic controls, lights, the driver screen, gauges, etc. High voltage handles the power electronics such as the Battery, the solar array, charging circuits, the electric motor, etc.

### Who Should Join
We are in particular need of EE, CPE, and CS engineers right now but anyone and everyone who would be excited to contribute to a project like this should join! Mechanical, Aerospace, Electrical, Photonics, Business, etc. are all welcome and needed!
